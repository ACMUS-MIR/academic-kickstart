abstract: "In the context of the ACMus research project, we are investigating automatic techniquesfor annotation and segmentation of digital archives of non-western music. In particular,we are focusing on a collection of traditional Colombian music compiled in the MúsicasRegionales archive at the Universidad de Antioquia in Medellín, Colombia. Of particularinterest are a series of recordings of vocal expressions of indigenous cultures native to differentregions of the country. These vocal expressions can either be very close to speech (almost asreciting something), can include some melodic elements, or can be closer to the concept ofsinging voice from a Western music perspective (exhibiting a defined melodic line). From anautomatic classification point of view, the traditional binary discrimination between speechand singing voice falls short, calling for a more general characterization of vocal expressions.For example, one may use a range[0,1]with0being pure speech,1being singing voice (froma Western music perspective), and allowing everything that falls in between these bounds. Inthis context, interesting research questions arise: Is the degree of melodic elements in thesevocal expressions informative for the region where a recording was made? Can we concludethe functional aspects of these recordings (ritual, prayer, social, playful, healing) based onthis characterization? Could these categories be shared between different cultures?"
