We aim to develop methods for automatic classification of simple and compound meters in music. This task is particularly challenging in some music traditions where both duple and triple rhythms are combined. This practice, known  as sesquialtera, leads to the combination of 3/4 and 6/8 rhythmic patterns. Sesquialteras are common in  Colombian Bambucos, a music genre from the [Andes region in Colombia]({{< ref "/andes-music/index.md" >}})
