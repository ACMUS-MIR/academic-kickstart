The rhythms (genres) performed in Colombian Andean music can be broadly categorized in 3 types:

1. <mark>Waltz</mark> The first group includes derivations of the European Hispanic ternary colonial songbook whose genre with the greatest impact in America has been the waltz, but also includes other salon genres and peasant dances.
    Besides the waltzes themselves, this group also includes pasillos and guabinas, among others.

    <mark>Pasillo</mark> is a popular dance from Colombia that evolved from the European valse. This musical genre also exists in Venezuela as an Andean waltz, and  in Ecuador as an Ecuadorian pasillo. It is known that some Central and South American composers, among which the Argentine Terig Tucci stands out, have cultivated it. Pasillo is usually written in 3/4. Its most frequent form is ternary although there are binary and even quaternary pasillos.

    In Colombia there are three clearly identifiable types of pasillo: one that is born from the traditional expression to encourage regional celebrations called “pasillo fiestero” (partying pasillo), fast, lively and cheerful, whose dancing expression as a couple is demanding and colorful; the pasillo song, romantic and sentimental pasillo closely linked to the practice of nighttime serenades and the concert pasillo that is rooted in the popular, draws on academic knowledge and is positioned in the context of chamber music.

2. <mark>Bambuco</mark> Of the Andean-Colombian airs, it is the most common in the region. Its existence is mentioned as early as 1790 when the oath of Carlos IV was celebrated in the south of the country as the new king of Spain. Historically linked to the deeds of independence, it remains today among indigenous groups, black and mestizo communities, rural and urban. Bambucos are loose couple dance, song and festive folk dance, presents different names and musical species throughout the Andean and Pacific regions of Colombia.

    Its rhythm, characterized by syncopation and irregular accentuations uncommon to Central European scholarly music, initially led musicians to propose an excessively complex form of writing, a factor that influenced for decades so that this genre could not transcend the national borders. In 1957, the musician Luis Uribe Bueno puts into practice a writing proposal in 6/8 that allows metric-harmonic accents to be correctly located, and facilitates its reading and interpretation. However, given the peculiar characteristics of this genre, a writing is proposed combining, and sometimes simultaneously, the 3/4 and 6/8 meters (bi-metric). This phenomena is knowing as sesquialtera and came from ancient Iberian Hispanic and Colombian peasant dances.


3. <mark>Danza</mark> The third large group includes the genre called danza, which comes from the habaneras connected to the European Hispanic contradanzas.
    This rhythm, whose origins are not yet very clear, could go back to the African continent, and constitutes one of those aspects of Latin American music that crosses the territory from Mexico to Argentina, evolving in very different ways: habanera in Cuba, dance in Colombia, danzón in both countries, milonga in Argentina, maxixe in Brazil.
    Its rhythm comes from the contradanza (an adaptation of word country-dance) of the nineteenth century. This rhythm exists in the country as a bucolic song of longing, and as an instrumental expression of saloon music. In the Andes region, it is not used for dance today; however, it is used as a traditional dance among the people in the Pacific coast. The main rhythmic characteristic of Colombian danza is its simple binary metric, the occasional *stressing* of the first pulse and an accompanying rhythmic pattern as illustrated in Figure below.
