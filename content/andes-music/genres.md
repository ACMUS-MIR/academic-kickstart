The rhythms (genres) performed in Colombian Andean music can be broadly categorized in 3 types:

1. <mark>Waltz</mark> The first group includes derivations of the European Hispanic ternary colonial songbook [^1] whose genre with the greatest impact in America has been the waltz, but also includes other salon genres and peasant dances. 
Besides the waltzes themselves, this group also includes pasillos and guabinas, among others. [^1] Footnote

2. <mark>Bambuco</mark> The second group includes the bambuco, considered one of the *national rhythms*, which presents typical characteristics  of ancient Iberian Hispanic and Colombian peasant dances, 
typified as sesquialteras, whose main characteristics is the bi-metric behavior (3/4 - 6/8) within the melodic line or between the melody line and the rhythmic-harmonic accompaniment.

3. <mark>Danza</mark> The third large group includes the genre called danza, which comes from the habaneras connected to the European Hispanic contradanzas. 
The main rhythmic characteristic of Colombian danza is its simple binary metric, the occasional *stressing* of the first pulse and an accompanying rhythmic pattern as illustrated in Figure below.
