![Andes region of Colombia](/img/andes_small.png#floatright)
The Colombian Andes is one of the five major geographical and cultural regions in which the country was divided in an attempt to understand its physiographic and sociocultural diversity.

Generally speaking, the notion of Colombian Andean music comprises an instrumental ensemble of plucked strings (tiple, bandola, guitar) and occasionally small percussion. 
This format has become widespread throughout the region, mainly being used to perform pasillos, bambucos, guabinas, dances. 
These  and their repertoires coexist between the traditional-popular and academic worlds, with clear tendencies towards the chamber music paradigm.
