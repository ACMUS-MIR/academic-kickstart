Always being amazed by the world of media Christian early discovered a passion for music. His youth was guided by music with first steps in sound engineering, mixing and playing instruments. As a curious person with a penchant for technology, he also wanted to understand the underlying principles of sound, its creation and effects on the listener.
Christian found studies where all worlds came together and graduated with his engineering diploma in media technology in 2013. This award-winning diploma thesis has already been a co-operational research task at the university of technology Ilmenau and the Fraunhofer Institute of Media Technology. From there he worked in different industries like DCI, electro-mobility and medical healthcare before returning into the research sector again in 2019.
Currently Christian is a research scientist as well a PhD student at University of Ilmenau and Fraunhofer IDMT.

My research interests include:

 * Music Information Retrieval
 * Musicology
 * Automatic Speech Recognition
