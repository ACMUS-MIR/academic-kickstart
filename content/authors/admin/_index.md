The ACMus project explores the use of machine learning techniques for computational musicology, digital music archive management, and music information retrieval.  

Two main elements are the core of our project:  
1. Emphasis on semi-supervised and unsupervised machine learning techniques that minimally rely on the availability of annotated data for a specific task.  
2. Traditional [Colombian music]({{< ref "/andes-music/index.md" >}}) from the Andes region as the main focus of our study.
